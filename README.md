# Week-5-JavaScript-Lab2-Day-1

DESCRIPTION

Three webpages with different text swap functions. 

TODOs

[x] Create your own webpage with at least 3 pages and 3 js script files. (4 pages if you include index.html)
[x] Each page should have a header paragraph and button. The button will use JavaScript to change the text of the header and paragraph by changing its innerHTML.
[x] Add an index.html page to link your pages together in a nav.
[x] Bonus: Feel free to spruce things up with CSS or to add more tags you'd like to change.
[x] Bonus: exercise your skill by adding a little math or string template magic to your page. Get creative and have fun
